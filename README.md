#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
Answer: All three of these are used to declare variables. The scope of var is within the function. It can be redeclared but comes with different issues and so we do not prefer to use it. The scope of let is within the block, but it cannot be redeclared as var. const refers to constant. It cannot be changed as variable. It is used for fixed values and it must be initialized while declaration. The scope of const is also within the  block.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 
Answer: forEach() is kind of loop that is used for iterating arrays. It can iterate through array and perform operations on each elements of that array. It does not return a new array. map() also traverses  but returns a new array based on the operation performed on each elements. filter() as name suggests gives an array that has filtered results. That means, it returns an array with elements that satisfies a certain condition.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
Answer: In ES6, we can write function in concise way. They are used for simple operations and makes code cleaner. These type of functions do not have 'this' and so they use this from adjacent code.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
Answer: When we extract vales from arrays or objects in separate variables, it is called destructuring. It is helpful in a way that we do not need to access elements one by one.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
Answer: It is a method through which we can create strings  easily. In this case, backticks (`) are used. Thus, we can embed variables directly inside a string. In that case, ${...} is used. Thus, we can avoid string concatenation as well. We can also write multiline string without errors by using \n only.
